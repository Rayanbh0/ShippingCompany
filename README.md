# ShippingCompany
This project was meant to solve the client side issues when choosing the best shipment methods by building a system that does those calculations and suggest the methods using Java language.
-We used the OOP java in order to accomplish this project, it was a university final project for our second semester as Software Engineers.
-You can download this project files and try runnning it on eclipse or a compiler of your choice.
-The below instructions were given inhand as requirments sheet before the we started implementation.

Project Description: You  work  is  to  design  and implement  aGraphical  User Interfaceof  your Project 2, that allow the user to do the following:
1-You  have  several  products  to  be  shipped,  each  has  it  is  own box  size,(The  user  has  to  enter  the  shipment  quantities using GUI only)
2-The  user  can  enter  the  product  name,  and  sizes  and  weight, when  the  shipment  calculation  is  needed,  this  can done  only using the GUI
3-The shape of the products, may be cylindrical, cubic, pentagon,Also using GUI only,You have at the same time 2 different shipping options:1-Small Container with 2.59m height, 2.43m wide, and 6.06m length.2-Big Container with 2.59m height, 2.43m wide, and 12.01m length.
Thecontainers sizes and costs can be preprogramed, or can be also modified in theGUI(Optional), 
Where:ï‚·The shipping cost for big container is 1800 Euro whatever the shipment weight is.
The shipping cost for small container 1000 Euro for 500 kg or less, and 1200 Euro for weight morethan 500kg.
The GUI, will show the results of the best program that calculate the best shippingmethods according toyour regular shipping products:
1-Whatever the number of the products that you have.
2-Whatever the shape and size and type of the products.After reading the products information, the software must read the product quantities. T
he  program  must  read  from  user  the  order  information  for example:  100Lap,  200  Mouse,  150  Desktop,  200  LCD  screen,  then calculate the best shipping methods according to less price, 
for example (1 big container, or 2 big containers, or 1 big container and 1 small container, According  to  maximum  volume  of  the  shipment  and  the total  shipment weight).
